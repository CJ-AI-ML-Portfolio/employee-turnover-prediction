# Employee Turnover Prediction

## Project Description

This project aims to predict employee turnover using machine learning techniques. By analyzing various employee-related datasets, the project provides insights into the factors contributing to turnover and helps organizations improve workforce retention strategies. The project leverages Python libraries such as Pandas and Scikit-learn for data processing and model building.

## Objectives

- Analyze multiple datasets to identify patterns and trends related to employee turnover.
- Build a predictive model using machine learning to forecast employee turnover.
- Evaluate the model's performance and fine-tune it for optimal accuracy.
- Provide actionable insights to reduce turnover rates.

## Setup Instructions

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.6 or higher
- Libraries: Pandas, Scikit-learn, Matplotlib (for visualizations), Seaborn (for visualizations)

### Installation

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/CJ-AI-ML-Portfolio/employee-turnover-prediction.git

## Visualizations

Visualizations help understand the importance of various features and their correlation with each other. Here are some examples:

### Feature Importance

```python
# Plot feature importance
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
import numpy as np

importances = rf.feature_importances_
features = X.columns
indices = np.argsort(importances)[::-1]

plt.figure(figsize=(10, 6))
plt.title("Feature Importance")
plt.bar(range(X.shape[1]), importances[indices], align='center')
plt.xticks(range(X.shape[1]), features[indices], rotation=90)
plt.tight_layout()
plt.show()
